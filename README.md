# Find The Number (FTH)
Version: 2.0 | By: Fsubject

FTH is a simple terminal game coded in Python, to win the game you need to find the random number
how? Just type a number in the terminal and the program will answer by "Higher" or "Lower".

## 2.0?
Update? Yes!
We've just updated to 2.0, in this update we decide to make a GUI instead of the
basic terminal.

## Requirements
- Python3.7 or higher | 3.10 is recommended
- Pygame latest version

## Want to contribute?
You can! Just fork the repo, work and make a Pull Request. If the changes are good
or useful, then I accept.

## How it works?
- Transfer all downloaded files in the same folder
- Open a CMD in the folder
- Write in the CMD: "python main.py" or "python3 main.py" if you're on Linux
- Last step, have fun!
